# React-native test (MediaMonks)

## Rules:

Create a simple album list, photo list and photo detail application, using data from:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com. Make sure the data is persisted to reduce requests!

Your project should be written in either typescript or javascript and hosted on GitHub and shared with ‘TomAtterton', don’t forget to add your name to your GitHub profile. From the moment of the initial commit, you have 48 hours to do as much as you can (you can choose yourself when you start depending on when you have time). 

Try to keep your commits clear!

There are no rules other than it should run (after running npm install) on iOS and Android, just make it cool! Be sure to make use of a state container such as Redux or React Context.

You will be judged on things like architecture, readability, animation, git usage, design, performance, api usage, third party usage and more.

We know it's a short time span, and you'll be working on it in your spare time, so try and focus on your strengths.
